# The analytical Grass-Erosion Model (GEM)
An analytical model to calculate the overtopping flow velocity and the erosion depth along the crest and the landward slope of grass-covered flood defences. The GEM was introduced in Van Bergeijk et al. (2021) as part of a probalistic framework to calculate the failure probability by wave overtopping:

Van Bergeijk, V.M.; Verdonk, V.A.; Warmink, J.J.; Hulscher, S.J.M.H. The Cross-Dike Failure Probability by Wave Overtopping over Grass-Covered and Damaged Dikes. Water 2021, 13, 690. https://doi.org/10.3390/w13050690

This model couples the analytical model of wave overtopping flow velocities on dike crests and landward slopes developed by Van Bergeijk et al. (2019) to an adapted version of the erosion model by Hoffmans (2012). The generation of the volume distribution is described in Frankena (2019). See for more background:
